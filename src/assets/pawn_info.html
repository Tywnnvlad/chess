        <!-- About pawns here-->
        <p>
            A pawn may advance one or two squares forward on its first move, but only one square 
            forward for the remainder of the game. Pawns may capture opponent pieces one move 
            forward in the diagonal only. Pawns may not move through other pieces.

        <h2>En passant</h2>
        <p>
            En passant capture may be made by a pawn when a player initially moves 
            their pawn two squares, but had they only moved it by one square 
            it would be under attack by the opposing player's pawn. In this case 
            the opposing player may still capture the pawn as if it has only been 
            moved by one square. This special capture can be made on the next turn only.

        <h2>Pawn promotion</h2>
        <p>
             this occurs when a pawn is moved to a square of the last row on the 
             opposite side of the board from which its color began. When this happens,
              the player must exchange the pawn for either a queen, a knight,
               a bishop or a rook of the same color, onto the square where the promotion occurs.

        <h2>Algebraic Notation Identifier</h2>
        <p>Pawns are the only piece that do not have a specfic letter to identifiy 
            them within algebraic notation representations of chess games. Rather, a move made by a pawn 
            is signified by its lack of capital letter identifier.
