        <h1>Chess Rules</h1>
        <p>Chess is a strategic game played between two opponents on a square board 
            that is composed of 64 alternating smaller dark and light squares. Players
             are assigned a set of 16 pieces, one set black, and the other white. The 16 
             pieces are made up of six different types: eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, 
             two bishops, one queen and one king. At the start of the game, the pieces 
             are arranged as follows:</p><br>

        <br>
        <p>
            Note that the black queen begins on a dark square and the white queen 
            begins on a light square, otherwise the board is arranged the same for 
            both players.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Players alternate turns moving one piece at a time in accordance with 
            the move regulations specific to the piece. White always moves first. 
            If any piece is moved onto a square containing an opponent's piece, 
            the opponent's piece is taken out of play for the remainder of the
             game and said to have been captured. Pieces may not be moved onto 
             squares occupied by pieces of the same color. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The objective of the game is to force the opponent's king into checkmate. 
            A checkmate occurs when a king is put into a check position that it cannot 
            escape from. A check occurs when, on the next move, the king may be captured 
            by the opponent. The first player to achieve a checkmate against their opponent
             wins the game. A win may also occur if a player's opponent runs out of time on 
             the chess clock.Although the goal of the game is to put the opponent's king 
             into checkmate, the game may also end if one player resigns, or if the game 
             results in a draw. A draw occurs when neither player wins or loses because of 
             one of the following conditions:
        </p><br>
       <ul>
        <li>Agreement between the players to end in a draw</li> <br>
        <li>A condition known as Stalemate is reached in which one of the players has no 
            legal move options</li> <br>
        <li>Threefold repetition in which a player makes the same move three times in a 
            row and cannot make further game progress</li> <br>
        <li>Neither player makes progress in the form of moving their pawns and no pieces 
            have been captured over the span of fifty moves</li> <br>
        <li>If the game comes to a state where checkmate is not possible due to an 
            insufficient number of pieces on the board</li> <br>
       </ul>
       <p>  
        Individual pieces may be moved as follows:
       </p><br>
       <p>
        <b>Pawn:</b> A pawn may advance one or two squares forward on its first move, but only one 
        square forward for the remainder of the game. Pawns may capture opponent pieces one move 
        forward in the diagonal only. Pawns may not move through other pieces.
       </p><br> 
       <p>
        <b>Rook:</b> Rooks may move to any square in the horizontal or vertical of the square it
         currently occupies. Rooks may not move through other pieces unless in the case of castling.
       </p><br>
       <p>
       <b> Knight:</b> Knights are the only piece that my move through other pieces and may move 
        to squares located two squares nearest to it but not directly horizontal, vertical, 
        or diagonal.
       </p><br> 
       <p>
        <b>Bishop:</b> Bishops may move diagonally to any square from the square it occupies. 
        Bishops may not move through other pieces.
       </p><br> 
       <p>
        <b>Queen:</b> Queens may move to any square horizontal, vertical or diagonal 
        of the square they currently occupy. Queens may not move through other pieces.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        <b>King:</b> Kings may move to adjoining squares only, except in the case of castling.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        No piece may be moved in such a way that the move would result in the check of the player's own king.
       </p><br>

       <h2>Special moves</h2>
       <p>
        Castling is a special move that occurs between a player's king and one of the same 
        player's rooks. A castling move may only be performed if both the king and the participating 
        rook have not yet been moved during the current game. To perform the castling move the 
        king is moved two squares horizontal towards the participating rook, and the rook is moved 
        two squares horizontal towards the king. The king and the rook may pass through each other 
        to accomplish this move.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        En passant capture may be made by a pawn when a player initially moves their pawn two 
        squares, but had they only moved it by one square it would be under attack by the 
        opposing player's pawn. In this case the opposing player may still capture the pawn 
        as if it has only been moved by one square. This special capture can be made on the next turn only.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        Pawn promotion occurs when a pawn is moved to a square of the last row on the
         opposite side of the board from which its color began. When this happens, the 
         player must exchange the pawn for either a queen, a knight, a bishop or a rook 
         of the same color, onto the square where the promotion occurs.
       </p><br>

       <h2>Time</h2>
       <p>
        Game time is controlled by a clock with a time display for each player, each player's 
        time runs only during that player's turn. Time is set to an agreed upon amount before the 
        start of the game. If a player runs out of time during game play, that player then loses the 
        match. For more information about time please see here.
       </p><br>

       <h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
       <p>
        Algebraic notation is the method by which chess games are recording move by move. 
        Each square on the chessboard is assigned a coordinate based on its row and column 
        position. Rows and columns, from white's point of view, are called ranks and files, 
        respectively. Squares along the rank are labeled alphabetically, left to right, from a to h. 
        Squares along the file are labeled numerically, top to bottom, from 1 to 8. 
        The left side of the board from white's point of view is referred to as queenside, and the right as kingside.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        The algebraic notation system of coordinates can be seen in the following image:

       </span><br>
       <p>
        Piece types also have algebraic identifiers except for the pawn. The others are as follows:
       </p><br>
       <ul>
           <li>Rook – R</li>
           <li>Knight – N</li>
           <li>Bishop – B</li>
           <li>Queen – Q</li>
           <li>King – K</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Moves are recorded according to the piece's upper-case letter (except in the case of a 
        pawn move which does not include an upper-case letter) followed by the coordinate of the
         square that the piece moved to. If a capture took place during the move an x is included
          between the uppercase identifier and the coordinate of the destination square. For example,
           Qxd8 would indicate that queen captures the piece on d8. Pawn captures are recorded by 
           including the rank location of the pawn at the start of the move coordinate. For example, 
           dxc5 would indicate that the pawn on square d4 moved to square c5 and made a capture. 
           If a pawn makes an En passant capture, the move is recorded with "e.p." at the end.
       </p><br>
       <h2>Recording special case moves</h2>
       <p>
        If two or more pieces can move to the same square the piece that is moved must be 
        identified by including either the file departure or the rank departure or both in the record. Example: Rde8
       </p><br>
       <p>
        Pawn promotions are recorded by including an equal sign followed by the uppercase indication of 
        what type of piece the pawn was promoted to at the end of the move record. Example: b8=Q
       </p><br>
       <p>
        Castling is recorded with "O-O" for kingside castling and "O-O-O" for queenside castling.
       </p><br>
       <p>
        Check is recorded by including "+" at the end of the record. Example: Rb1+
       </p><br>
       <p>
        Checkmate is recorded by including "#" at the end of the record. Example: Rb1#
       </p><br>
       <p>
        A Draw is recorded by and equal sign in parentheses. (=)
       </p><br>
       <p>
        The end of the game is indicated with the conclusion of the game represented as follows: 
       </p><br>
       <ul>
            <li>White won: 1-0</li><br>
            <li>Black won: 0-1</li><br>
            <li>Draw: ½-½</li><br>
            <li>White forfeit: 0-½</li><br>
            <li>Black forfeit: ½-0</li><br>
            <li>Both forfeit: 0-0</li><br>
            <li>Loss by default: +/-, -/+ or -/-</li><br>
       </ul> 
       <p>
