        <!-- About This App-->
        <p>Created in 2021, Java Chess provides a platform for users to play a game of 
            chess against another human player, play against an artificial player,
             or to watch a chess game simulation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Java chess displays gameplay on both a traditional chess board
             and within an algebraic notation view port. PGN file format is 
             supported to allow users to save and load games.

            A full tutorial mode is available to teach novice chess players 
            the basics of the game. This tutorial mode guides new players through a 
            match using notifications, move hints, board highlighting and the ability to
            undo/redo moves. Detailed information about each chess piece is 
            also accessible within the tutorial mode.

            The ability to choose between three modes of gameplay at varying 
            levels of difficulty, the inclusion of both a graphical and a 
            textual playing experience, and a robust, but optional, tutorial
             with additional help features allows players of any ability, 
             from novice to master, to enjoy the game of chess.
